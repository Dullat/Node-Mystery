## **16. Is Node.js Multi-Threaded?**

### **1. The Short Answer**

- **JavaScript execution in Node.js** = **single-threaded** (runs in the main thread via V8).
    
- **Node.js as a platform** = **multi-threaded under the hood** (thanks to libuv, OS kernel, and worker threads).

### **2. How It Works Under the Hood**

When your code calls something like:

```js
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', callback);
```

The process is:

1. **JS main thread** â†’ Calls Nodeâ€™s C++ bindings.
    
2. **libuv decides**:
    
    - If the OS has a native async API â†’ delegate directly to **OS kernel** (e.g., networking sockets, timers).
        
    - If not â†’ assign the task to **libuvâ€™s thread pool** (default size: 4 threads).
        
3. When the work is done:
    
    - OS/kernel or thread pool notifies libuv.
        
    - libuv puts your callback into the **event loop queue**.
        
4. Main thread picks it up when ready â†’ callback runs.

### **3. Why Node Avoids Thread Pool When Possible**

- Thread pool threads are limited (4 by default).
    
- If all are busy, further tasks **wait** â†’ latency increases.
    
- OS kernel has **more threads and better optimizations** for certain async tasks (especially networking).
    
- Example:
    
    - **TCP/HTTP requests** â†’ handled almost entirely by kernel.
        
    - **File I/O** â†’ often handled by libuv thread pool.

### **4. Default Thread Pool Size**

- `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 4` by default.
    
- Can be changed:
    

```bash
UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=8 node app.js
```

ðŸ’¡ Increasing this helps for CPU-heavy async operations (hashing, compression), but not for pure networking.

---

### **5. Networking vs File I/O**

- **Networking** (HTTP, sockets):
    
    - OS kernel uses its own networking stack and threads.
        
    - Node just waits for the OS to tell it data is ready.
        
    - This means thousands of sockets can be handled without extra threads.
        
- **File I/O**:
    
    - No native async in many OS file systems â†’ handled by libuvâ€™s thread pool.
        

---

### **6. Why This Matters**

- You donâ€™t need threads to handle thousands of requests in Node.
    
- You _do_ need to avoid **CPU-heavy work** on the main thread (it blocks everything).
    
- If you must do CPU-heavy tasks â†’ use **Worker Threads** or **offload to another process**.
