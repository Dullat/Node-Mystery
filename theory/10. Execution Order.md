This is **the core** of async behavior in Node, and it’s where **libuv’s event loop + V8’s microtask queue** work together.

## **12. Execution Order & Queues in Node.js**

### **Two Worlds to Remember**

When you run async code in Node:

1. **JavaScript side (V8 engine)**
    
    - Handles **synchronous execution**.
        
    - Maintains a **microtask queue** for promises and `process.nextTick()`.
        
2. **libuv (C library)**
    
    - Manages **macrotasks** like timers, I/O, and `setImmediate`.
        
    - Runs the **event loop phases**.
        

---

## **1. Microtasks vs Macrotasks**

### **Microtasks** (Highest Priority)

- Executed **immediately after** the current JS function finishes, **before** the event loop continues.
    
- **Two types in Node:**
    
    - **`process.nextTick()`** → Node-specific, runs **before** other microtasks.
        
    - **Promises** (`.then()`, `.catch()`, `.finally()`).
        

**Priority:**

```
process.nextTick → Promises
```

---

### **Macrotasks**

- Scheduled by libuv’s event loop phases.
    
- Examples:
    
    - `setTimeout`
        
    - `setInterval`
        
    - `setImmediate`
        
    - I/O callbacks (like `fs.readFile`)
        

---

## **2. Event Loop Phases & Where Things Go**

Here’s the **simplified order per tick**:

```
[Microtasks: process.nextTick() + Promises]  
→ Timers Phase (setTimeout, setInterval)  
→ Pending Callbacks  
→ Idle, Prepare (internal)  
→ Poll Phase (I/O callbacks)  
→ Check Phase (setImmediate)  
→ Close Callbacks
```

💡 After **every phase**, Node checks the **microtask queue** again — meaning `nextTick` and promises can run **between phases**.

---

## **3. Execution Order Examples**

### Example 1 — `process.nextTick` vs Promise

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("⏳ Timeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("⚡ Immediate"));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("💎 Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("🚀 NextTick"));
```

**Output:**

```
🚀 NextTick     // Highest priority
💎 Promise      // Then promises
⏳ Timeout      // Timers phase
⚡ Immediate    // Check phase
```

---

### Example 2 — `setTimeout` vs `setImmediate`

- If both are called from the **main script**:
    

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("⏳ Timeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("⚡ Immediate"));
```

**Possible Output:**

```
⏳ Timeout
⚡ Immediate
```

(Because timers phase comes before check phase **in the first tick**.)

- If both are inside an I/O callback:
    

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
  setTimeout(() => console.log("⏳ Timeout"), 0);
  setImmediate(() => console.log("⚡ Immediate"));
});
```

**Output:**

```
⚡ Immediate
⏳ Timeout
```

(Because after I/O, the next phase is **check** — so `setImmediate` wins.)

---

## **4. Analogy**

Think of it like an airport:

- **`process.nextTick`** → VIP passengers who board before anyone else.
    
- **Promises** → Business class passengers (still board before regular).
    
- **Timers (`setTimeout`)** → Regular passengers, board when gate opens (timers phase).
    
- **`setImmediate`** → Last call passengers (check phase).
    
- **I/O callbacks** → Arrivals waiting for connection flights.
    

---

## **5. Rules to Remember**

1. **`process.nextTick` > Promises > Anything else**
    
2. **Timers phase comes before Check phase** — unless inside I/O.
    
3. Microtasks run **between every event loop phase**.
    
4. Long-running sync code delays **everything**, even microtasks.

## program


```js
const fs = require('fs')


setImmediate(() => { console.log('immediate..') })
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log('timeout fnished on 0 sec')
})
process.nextTick(() => console.log('a tick'))


fs.readFile(__filename, () => {
    console.log('enter inside the readfile->')
    // immediate runs after the loop finish but before the io, so that why immediate logs first in fs
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('timeout from callback')
    })
    setImmediate(() => { console.log('immediate from call back') })
})
```



| Output                          | Phase             | Notes                                                    |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a tick`                        | Microtask         | Runs before event loop starts                            |
| `timeout fnished on 0 sec`      | Timers (1st loop) | `setTimeout(..., 0)` fires                               |
| `immediate..`                   | Check (1st loop)  | `setImmediate()` fires after timers                      |
| *(I/O completes between loops)* |                   | `fs.readFile` finishes async read                        |
| `enter inside the readfile->`   | Poll (2nd loop)   | Callback executes in poll phase                          |
| `immediate from call back`      | Check (2nd loop)  | `setImmediate()` scheduled inside I/O fires here         |
| `timeout from callback`         | Timers (3rd loop) | `setTimeout()` inside I/O fires in the next timers phase |

## 🧠 Key Clarification:
fs.readFile starts in the first loop, but its callback doesn’t get executed until the poll phase of a later iteration, after the file has been read from disk.

So it's not that it reaches the poll phase in the 1st loop and waits — the event loop doesn't wait in a single iteration. Instead:

If there's no I/O ready in the poll phase, the loop moves on. Once I/O is ready, the callback is queued and will run in the poll phase of a future iteration.


## Visulization

```pgsql

[Synchronous / Microtasks]
→ a tick

[1st Event Loop Iteration]
→ Timers Phase       : timeout fnished on 0 sec
→ Check Phase        : immediate..

[2nd Event Loop Iteration]
→ Poll Phase         : enter inside the readfile->
                        → schedules new setTimeout & setImmediate
→ Check Phase        : immediate from call back

[3rd Event Loop Iteration]
→ Timers Phase       : timeout from callback
```
