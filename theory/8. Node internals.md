libuv Internals & The Event Loop**

```js
You can go to the node's and Libuv's official repo in gthub
There you can check the functions and files like fs and open, close etc
```
### **What is libuv?**

- A **C library** that Node.js uses for:
    
    - **Asynchronous I/O**
        
    - **Thread pool** (for CPU-heavy tasks)
        
    - **Timers**
        
    - **Networking**
        
- It hides OS-level differences so Node code works on **Linux, macOS, Windows** without changes.

## **How the Event Loop Works**

The **event loop** is the **orchestrator** that decides when your callbacks run.

üí° **Key Idea:**  
JavaScript in Node is **single-threaded** ‚Äî but the event loop + libuv let it handle multiple tasks concurrently by **delegating work**.

---

### **Event Loop Phases (Simplified)**

Each loop iteration is called a **"tick"**.

1. **Timers Phase**
    
    - Executes callbacks from `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` whose time has expired.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer done"), 1000);
        ```
        
2. **Pending Callbacks Phase**
    
    - Executes certain system-level callbacks (not often used directly).
        
3. **Idle, Prepare (Internal)**
    
    - Used internally by Node/libuv ‚Äî you won‚Äôt directly work with these.
        
4. **Poll Phase**
    
    - Waits for new I/O events (file read, network request, etc.)
        
    - Executes I/O callbacks that are ready.
        
5. **Check Phase**
    
    - Executes callbacks from `setImmediate()`.
        
    - Runs right after the poll phase.
        
6. **Close Callbacks Phase**
    
    - Executes callbacks for closed resources (like `socket.on('close')`).

### **Microtasks vs Macrotasks**

- **Microtasks** (priority queue):
    
    - `process.nextTick()` (Node-specific, runs immediately after current function finishes)
        
    - Promises (`.then()`, `.catch()`)
        
    - These run **between phases** before the event loop moves on.
        
- **Macrotasks**:
    
    - `setTimeout()`, `setImmediate()`, I/O callbacks.
        

---

### **Execution Priority Example**

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timeout"), 0);
setImmediate(() => console.log("Immediate"));
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log("Promise"));
process.nextTick(() => console.log("NextTick"));
```

**Possible output:**

```
NextTick
Promise
Timeout
Immediate
```

Why?

- `process.nextTick` ‚Üí Runs first (before promises)
    
- Promises ‚Üí Run after `nextTick`, still before timers
    
- Then timers (`setTimeout`)
    
- Then check phase (`setImmediate`)

### **How This Connects to libuv**

When you run:

```js
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', callback);
```

1. JS call ‚Üí V8 executes ‚Üí binding ‚Üí libuv thread pool.
    
2. libuv tells the OS to read the file asynchronously.
    
3. OS notifies libuv when done.
    
4. libuv places the callback in the event loop‚Äôs **poll phase**.
    
5. Event loop eventually executes your callback.

### **Why This Is Important for You**

- Explains **why ‚Äúasync‚Äù code in Node doesn‚Äôt block**.
    
- Helps predict execution order of timers, promises, `setImmediate`.
    
- Crucial for avoiding race conditions in backend logic.
