Alright â€” letâ€™s dig into **Multi-Threading, Processes, and Threads** in the context of Node.js.

## **15. Multi-Threading, Processes & Threads in Node.js**

### **1. Processes vs Threads â€” The Basics**

- **Process** â†’ An instance of a running program.
    
    - Has its own memory space, heap, stack.
        
    - Independent from other processes.
        
- **Thread** â†’ A unit of execution within a process.
    
    - Shares the processâ€™s memory space.
        
    - Multiple threads can run inside the same process.
        

ðŸ’¡ Analogy:

- **Process** = Restaurant (independent kitchen, tables, staff)
    
- **Thread** = Waiters inside that restaurant, working on different orders.


```js
function foo1(){
	foo2()
}

function foo2(){
	return 23
}

new Thread(foo1())   // created its own callstack
new Thread(foo2())   // created its own callstack
```

## **2. Node.js Is Single-Threaded for JavaScript**

- Node runs **JavaScript execution** in **a single main thread** (via V8).
    
- But Node itself is **not entirely single-threaded**:
    
    - It has a **libuv thread pool** (default 4 threads) for I/O and heavy tasks.
        
    - Uses OS-level threads for background operations.
        

---

## **3. Where Extra Threads Are Used**

Node uses the thread pool for:

- File system operations (`fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`)
    
- Some crypto operations (`crypto.pbkdf2`, `scrypt`)
    
- DNS lookups (`dns.lookup` in certain modes)
    
- Compression (`zlib`)

## **4. Multi-Threading in Node**

- **Worker Threads** module (since Node 10.5) lets you run JS in multiple threads.
    
- Workers have separate V8 instances and memory â€” communicate via messages.
    

**Example:**

```js
// main.js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

console.log("Main thread starts");

const worker = new Worker(`
  const { parentPort } = require('worker_threads');
  parentPort.postMessage("Hello from worker!");
`, { eval: true });

worker.on('message', msg => console.log(msg));

console.log("Main thread continues");
```

## **5. Processes in Node**

- You can spawn multiple processes using the `child_process` module.
    
- Good for:
    
    - Running another Node script
        
    - Using external commands (like `python`, `ffmpeg`)
        

**Example:**

```js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const ls = spawn('ls', ['-lh']);

ls.stdout.on('data', data => {
  console.log(`Output: ${data}`);
});
```

## **6. Threads vs Processes in Node**

|Feature|Thread (Worker Threads)|Process (Child Process)|
|---|---|---|
|Memory Space|Shared|Separate|
|Startup Cost|Low|Higher|
|Isolation|Low (shared state)|High (full isolation)|
|Communication|Message passing|Message passing / Streams|

## **7. Nodeâ€™s Execution Model Summary**

- **Main Thread** â†’ Runs your JS code, handles event loop.
    
- **Thread Pool** â†’ Handles I/O and heavy work in background.
    
- **Worker Threads** â†’ Optional, run JS in parallel threads.
    
- **Child Processes** â†’ Optional, run separate programs.
