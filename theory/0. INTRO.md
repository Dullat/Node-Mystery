## **1. Introduction to Node.js**

### **What is Node.js?**

- **Definition:**  
    Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime environment** that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser.
    
- **Built on:**
    
    - **V8 JavaScript Engine** (same engine that powers Chrome)
        
    - **libuv** (C library for async I/O operations)
        
- **Purpose:**  
    Originally created to enable **server-side JavaScript**.
    
- **Creator:**  
    Ryan Dahl, 2009.

### **Why was Node.js created?**

- Before Node, JavaScript was **browser-only**.
    
- Web servers used other languages (PHP, Python, Ruby, Java).
    
- Node solved the problem of **real-time, event-driven, scalable servers** using JS.

### **Key Characteristics**

1. **Event-driven architecture**
    
    - Code execution happens through events and callbacks.
        
2. **Non-blocking I/O**
    
    - Handles many requests at once without waiting for one to finish.
        
3. **Single-threaded**
    
    - Uses one thread for JS execution, but **libuv** handles I/O in background threads.
        
4. **Cross-platform**
    
    - Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux.

### **Where Node.js is Used**

- Web servers & APIs (REST, GraphQL)
    
- Real-time applications (chat, games)
    
- Command-line tools (npm, webpack, etc.)
    
- Streaming services (Netflix, Spotify backend parts)
    
- Microservices

## **2. Node.js Runtime**

The **runtime** is the environment where JS executes â€” in Nodeâ€™s case, it includes much more than the browser.

**Node.js Runtime Components:**

1. **V8 Engine**
    
    - Compiles JS into machine code.
        
    - Super fast because it uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
        
2. **libuv**
    
    - Handles asynchronous operations like file I/O, networking, timers.
        
    - Implements the **event loop** and thread pool.
        
3. **C++ bindings**
    
    - Connects JavaScript (V8) with C++ features (libuv functions).
        
4. **Node APIs**
    
    - Extra features not available in browsers:
        
        - File system access (`fs` module)
            
        - Networking (`http` module)
            
        - Process control (`process` object)

### **How Node.js Executes JavaScript**

1. You run a `.js` file â†’ Node passes the code to **V8**.
    
2. V8 compiles JS into machine code.
    
3. Node APIs handle any async operations via **libuv**.
    
4. **Event loop** schedules callbacks when operations finish.
    
5. Your code continues executing without blocking.

ðŸ’¡ **Key Difference from Browser Runtime:**

- Browser runtime = JS + Web APIs + DOM
    
- Node runtime = JS + Node APIs + no DOM
    
- Instead of DOM manipulation, Node focuses on **server tasks**.
